						Storyboard
Setting: Gaming School known as Game Center
The School's rankings have 7 divisions- from lowest to highest, bronze, silver, gold, platinum, diamond, master, and grandmaster.
The Master divsion is the highest ranking division and in the top 200 in the master division are grandmasters and consist of pros and/or individuals with the skills to become pro.

	In this school, gaming is everything. They teach the concepts of gaming, the different genres, the tactics and strategy, how to coordinate with your team using timing and communication.
They tell the stories of past gaming legends and all the great things they have achieved. This school's goal is to forge gaming legends. This school is called Game Center.

	After the initial classes of learning concepts, strategy, tactics, timing, synergy, teamwork, communication, and history, the students are then given a placement exam where they will be given a rank to start off to work towards the top.
Students placed high have a much easier time finding people to work with based on their skills and are highly sought after. 
Lower placed students however, have a much harder time because no one wants them.

	Story 1: Main character places silver/gold with intermediate skills and knowledge and eventually decides to work with bronze teamates because no one else would and he sees something in them that no one else does.

	Story 2: Main character places into bronze and can't find anyone to work with until someone else who placed silver/gold with intermediate skills and knowledge scouts him/her out and works with the main character to climb to the top.

Note 1: Main character's gender and name have not been decided.
note 2: Platforming game can be one of the school's tests as placement. (to make our game not invalid)
